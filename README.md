Directions:
to download: wget https://github.com/ProbAlex/CF-Handler/releases/latest/download/CF-Handler.py && chmod +x CF-Handler.py
to run: python3 CF-Handler.py
to stop: ctrl+c 
Note: This script only works on Linux as I refuse to test Catflipper on my personal computer. If there is high demand for a windows port, I will do it at a public library.
